<p class="header"><span class="CenterTitle">Case Studies</span> of Classroom Practice</p>
<p>These case studies provide examples of how teachers from a range of schools have  planned and implemented quality Technology units. They include projects from all levels of teaching &ndash; from Year 1 to Year 13.
In most cases, they were written by the teachers who planned and delivered the units, which they contributed as part of their involvement with the Techlink site in its early years.</p>
<p>These case studies remain a unique and invaluable source of information and inspiration for Technology teachers at all levels. A wide range of in-depth case studies of Classroom Practice can also be found on the <a href="/Case-studies/Classroom-practice/index.htm">Beacon Practice case studies</a> pages of this site.</p>
