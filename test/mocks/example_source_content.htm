<p class="subhead">Introduction</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education developed the Technology Curriculum Support package in 2007 to support schools and teachers with the implementation of the technology curriculum in <em>The New Zealand Curriculum</em>. The papers included in the package were developed to explain and exemplify the underpinning ideas within the technology curriculum in <em>The New Zealand Curriculum</em> and reflected a significant body of research and classroom practice.</p>

<p><a name="curric-national" id="curric-national"></a><strong>National Curriculum</strong></p>
<p>The National Curriculum for technology is the document provided by the Ministry of Education that sets out the direction for learning in technology. It includes the Technology Introductory Learning Area Statement and Achievement Objectives that progress from level 1-8 of the New Zealand curriculum framework.</p>
<p><a name="curric-school" id="curric-school"></a><strong>School Curriculum</strong></p>
<p>The school curriculum for technology will be developed by all staff involved in the leadership and delivery of technology in the school. The school technology curriculum will be recorded by way of technology programmes that guide all staff teaching within it. Technology programmes will be in line with the expectations within the national technology curriculum, but will also take into account the needs and desires of the school community, the strengths of the teaching staff, and the interests and ability of the students.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.tki.org.nz/r/nzcurriculum/draft-curriculum/achievement_objectives_e.php" target="_blank" title=".pdf document">achievement objectives</a> are the outcomes for student learning that have been determined to be key for all students across New Zealand. In technology the achievement objectives have been derived from each component within the strands. They provide a generic description of what student achievement should reflect at level 1 through to level 8.</p>
<p><a name="curric-classroom" id="curric-classroom"></a><strong>Classroom Curriculum</strong></p>
<p>The classroom curriculum for technology will be developed by classroom teachers to guide their teaching. The classroom curriculum can be recorded as a unit. Units will be developed in line with the school technology programme, but will also take into account the specific interests and abilities of the teacher/s and students within the classroom.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The development of context specific knowledge and skill achievement standards for technology; and</li>
    <li>The development of the Technology Teaching and Learning Guides.</li>
  </ul>

<p>This provides opportunity for recording an overview of the planned learning experiences (including teacher interactions) that students will be provided with throughout the unit. In developing these experiences teachers should take guidance from the <em>Learning Environment</em> indicators in the <em>Indicators of Progression</em>. The experiences should be developed to ensure that opportunity is provided to allow students to meet the <em>predetermined specific learning outcomes </em>and links to key competencies, values and other curriculum knowledge and/or skills should be made as appropriate. Strategies to gather assessment data for different learning outcomes can also be included in appropriate places throughout the unit.</p>
